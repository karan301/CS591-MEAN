# Project Grading Criteria
Here are some guidelines to how I'll be grading your projects. These are high-level and would be worth roughly 10 points or so, some more, some less. I'll keep this updated if other items come to mind. My goal in grading is to see how well you've implemented concepts that we've covered in class.

I'm looking for:

- Application runs during in-class demo
- App is configured correctly, i.e. no API keys, tokens, and so on are hard-coded but rather are in config files
- REST interface is correctly implemented in back-end routes
- Routes are in their own files and use the Express.Router (rather than app.get, app.post, and so on)
- All third-party API calls are done from the back end
- Angular used for front end (no EJS/Pug, etc)
- OAUTH works and at least one route is protected
- Code is commented
- Back-end data stored in mongoDB
